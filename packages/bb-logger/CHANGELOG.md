## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 3c56267: `AuthBasic` and `Logger` now report `bbName`/`bbVersion` to `Scope`, so they appear in telemetry like every other Building Block.

  Both were listed in the umbrella's `aws-blocks.vendorize` map, so `scripts/generate-bb-names.mjs` had already generated them into `OFFICIAL_BB_NAMES` — but neither passed `bbMeta` to `super()`, and `Scope` only records a block in its registry when `bbName` is set. Their entries in that set were therefore inert: `Scope.getRegisteredBlocks()` could never name either block, so `product.buildingBlocks` under-reported two of the most widely used blocks. Each package now carries the standard `prebuild` (`generate-version.mjs AuthBasic` / `Logger`), which generates the `BB_NAME`/`BB_VERSION` its constructor passes through — the same wiring the other blocks use.

  `Logger` is composed internally by most other blocks (`new Logger(this, 'logger', { level: 'error' })`), so it will now be reported for effectively every application, and `totalCount` rises accordingly. That is the intended reading of the existing `Logger` entry in the vendorize map, not a new disclosure: `getRegisteredBlocks()` still exposes only names already on the official list, and customer-chosen block names remain counted-but-unnamed.

  `@aws-blocks/blocks` takes a `patch` because it re-exports both blocks; sibling releases stay inside its caret range, so `changeset version` would not bump it on its own (#273, #212). `@aws-blocks/core` needs no bump — both names were already present in the generated `OFFICIAL_BB_NAMES`, so that file is byte-identical.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- ba3bf7b: docs: add per-package DESIGN.md documents

  Adds a `DESIGN.md` to each building-block package describing its architecture, API surface, mock implementation, and key design decisions.

  - Each document is cross-checked against the current source so identifiers, environment variables, error names, and described behavior match the implementation.
  - Each `DESIGN.md` is listed in its package's `files` array so it ships on npm alongside `README.md`.
  - For consistency, `bb-auth-cognito`'s document lives at the package root like every other package.
  - Bumps the umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` package so its bundled `docs/` — assembled from these block READMEs at build time — republishes with a fresh version. Its packed content changes whenever the READMEs change, but the version was previously left untouched, which tripped the publish integrity guard.
