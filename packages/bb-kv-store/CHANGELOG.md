### Patch Changes

- 309a236: refactor(bb): attach IAM grants to the shared execution role
  
  Data and auth blocks now grant permissions to the shared Blocks execution role
  (`this.executionRole`) instead of the handler function directly. Grants land on
  the same role the handler assumes, so the effective runtime permissions are
  identical — this decouples IAM wiring from the concrete Lambda function ahead of
  the multi-compute model.
  
  For `bb-distributed-data`, the DSQL endpoint and region now flow through the
  config registry (loaded into `process.env` at cold start, like every other
  block) rather than being set as direct handler environment variables, and the
  migration Lambda maps the shared execution role's ARN.

### Patch Changes

- 7b4c62d: Add infrastructure `defaults` chosen once at the app entry point, replacing the per-block `sandboxMode` logic and the `RemovalPolicies`/`SandboxDisableDeletionProtection` mixin dance for removal-policy and deletion-protection.
  
  `@aws-blocks/core/cdk` now exports `BlocksDefaults` and the `BlocksPresets.sandbox` / `BlocksPresets.production` starting points. `BlocksStack.create` / `BlocksBackend.create` take a required `defaults` prop; start from a preset and override individual fields with a spread. `defaults` is anchored on the owning `BlocksStack`/`BlocksBackend` (resolved by walking up the construct tree, like `handler`/`executionRole`), so multiple backends in one stack each keep their own posture. Building Blocks read the resolved values via `scope.defaults`, and a per-block option always wins (`option ?? scope.defaults.field`).
  
  Adopted across the stateful Building Blocks: `bb-kv-store`, `bb-data`, `bb-distributed-data`, `bb-distributed-table`, and `bb-knowledge-base` now take their removal policy and deletion protection from `defaults` instead of reading the `sandboxMode` context themselves. (`bb-distributed-table` reads `defaults` directly for now; a richer per-block `protection` override lands with #282.)
  
  The `create-blocks-app` scaffolding templates are updated to pass `defaults: sandboxMode ? BlocksPresets.sandbox : BlocksPresets.production` (replacing the `RemovalPolicies`/`SandboxDisableDeletionProtection` mixin), so newly-generated apps satisfy the required prop.
  
  **Breaking:** `BlocksStack.create` / `BlocksBackend.create` now require a `defaults` field — pass `BlocksPresets.sandbox` or `BlocksPresets.production` (typically `sandboxMode ? BlocksPresets.sandbox : BlocksPresets.production`). The previously-shipped experimental `hardening` prop and its `resolve*` helpers are removed; log-retention, API throttling, access-logging and point-in-time-recovery move into `defaults` in follow-up, per-feature changes.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- b83aaba: Add opt-in TTL support to `KVStore` and use it to expire `AuthCognito` session records.

  `KVStore` gains a `ttl` construct option that enables DynamoDB Time-to-Live on the table, plus per-write expiry via `put(key, value, { ttlSeconds })` or `{ expiresAt }`. Both default to off, so existing tables and every existing `put()` call are unaffected. Because DynamoDB deletes expired items asynchronously, `get` and `scan` also filter expired items on read in every runtime, and the local mock emulates the same expiry semantics. Maintenance sweeps that need to act on rows the reaper has not collected yet can opt out with `scan({ includeExpired: true })`.

  `AuthCognito` now enables TTL on its sessions table and stamps each session write with `now + sessionTtlSeconds`. Session records store live Cognito refresh tokens, so without an expiry the table grew without bound and retained those credentials at rest indefinitely; abandoned sessions are now reaped automatically. Authorization is unchanged — validity is still decided by token revalidation on every request.

  Two things to know before upgrading:

  - **Your next `cdk deploy` enables TTL on the existing sessions table.** Even though this is a patch, `AuthCognito` now passes `{ ttl: true }`, so the deploy issues a one-time `UpdateTimeToLive` against the live table. That is an online, non-disruptive DynamoDB operation — no downtime, no data loss — but it is a mutation of a live resource, so it shouldn't surprise anyone diffing a patch upgrade.
  - **Only sessions written after the upgrade expire.** A missing `ttl` attribute means "never expires" (matching DynamoDB), and existing rows are not backfilled, so sessions created before the upgrade keep their refresh tokens at rest indefinitely. Backfilling would need a one-time migration writing `ttl` onto every existing row. To close the retention gap immediately, revoke the pre-existing sessions instead — the revoke sweep deletes rows regardless of expiry state.

### Patch Changes

- 683bf49: fix(bb-kv-store): discover tests via a glob so the user-agent suite runs

  The `test` script enumerated compiled test files by hand and had drifted from
  the real sources: it ran a non-existent `dist/logger-injection.test.js` (a stale
  leftover) and omitted `dist/user-agent.test.js`, so the user-agent integration
  suite silently never ran in CI — a false green.

  The script now globs `dist/*.test.js` (matching the `bb-email-client` /
  `bb-tracer` idiom and keeping `--test-concurrency=1`), so every compiled test
  file is auto-discovered and the enumerate-and-omit drift is structurally
  impossible. Enabling the user-agent suite surfaced a stale, never-run test that
  expected a custom (non-official) ancestor BB to appear in the user-agent chain;
  per `@aws-blocks/core`'s design only official BB names are emitted, so that test
  was corrected and a case asserting custom names are excluded was added. No
  runtime change to `@aws-blocks/core`.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- ba3bf7b: docs: add per-package DESIGN.md documents

  Adds a `DESIGN.md` to each building-block package describing its architecture, API surface, mock implementation, and key design decisions.

  - Each document is cross-checked against the current source so identifiers, environment variables, error names, and described behavior match the implementation.
  - Each `DESIGN.md` is listed in its package's `files` array so it ships on npm alongside `README.md`.
  - For consistency, `bb-auth-cognito`'s document lives at the package root like every other package.
  - Bumps the umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` package so its bundled `docs/` — assembled from these block READMEs at build time — republishes with a fresh version. Its packed content changes whenever the READMEs change, but the version was previously left untouched, which tripped the publish integrity guard.
